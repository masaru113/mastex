\section{Wed., October 1, 2025}

I gave my wife her allowance for this month, but our household budget is barely holding up.



\section{Thu., October 2, 2025}

I had planned to go eat Kenyan food with a friend for lunch,  
but the Kenyan restaurant was closed.

We had no choice but to go to our usual Peruvian restaurant in Gotanda.  
It was as delicious as always, so in the end, it turned out really well.

After lunch, we went to a café, had coffee, and talked.

We discussed how much participation in athletic clubs during student days helps with social adaptability.

He also mentioned that the students weak in mathematics at the prep school where he teaches often fail to copy formulas correctly, even before worrying about understanding what is written in the textbooks.

My friend was successfully accepted by a medical prep school,  
and not only that—he is already teaching three students.

After the café, we parted ways, and I went to the office in Shinjuku.

It was nice to talk with my friend and also chat with my team members.

On the way home, I stopped by a secondhand bookstore in Shinjuku,  
and ended up getting home past 8 p.m.



\section{Fri., October 3, 2025}

I spent the entire day working on my side business development.

The analysis batch for Yomi Sheet is almost done.

I talked with two team leaders about CA operation analysis,  
and also with another person who is developing a performance analysis system for CA on a separate project.

Apparently, the number of accepted offers is off by one digit.

I suspect the discrepancy might come from whether we first perform the aggregation at 30- or 90-day intervals, or whether we flag the most advanced process first — the difference in that order might be the cause.

In the evening, I went to Kitasenju to have dinner with a friend.

Kitasenju has many places that might serve biryani,  
but many of them are irregularly closed, so it's hard to actually eat it.

Today again, we ended up eating at Butayama, a ramen place in the Jiro style.

I handed my friend some books — one by Hannah Arendt and another on causal inference.

On the way back, we had a slow, relaxed conversation at our usual standing beer bar.

I told him that I want to re-enter a doctoral program and that I've already narrowed down the specific lab.

My friend said he's getting interested in corporate finance theory.

After returning home, I uploaded my notes on the Keldysh Green Function.



\section{Sat., October 4, 2025}

A day I slept almost all day.

Richard Rorty's \textit{Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity} arrived. I want to read it.

Around midnight — that is, at the moment when my age changes —  
I was studying how the comma category that equals the Grothendieck construction  
is expressed using the integral sign of a category as a category of elements.  
I was amazed to learn that integration also appears in category theory —  
and that there's even a version of Fubini's theorem.



\section{Sun., October 5, 2025}

I felt a bit sleep-deprived this morning.

I made some small revisions to my notes on Fermi liquid theory.

I've been studying limits in category theory.

Since today is my birthday, I had planned to go out for sushi,  
but my daughter was rampaging around the house, and my wife got exhausted,  
so we ended up buying side dishes from a bento shop and eating at home.

A used copy of the book on gauge/gravity duality by Ammon and Erdmenger happened to appear online, though it wasn't cheap.  
I had been thinking about buying it for a while, and since it's my birthday, I decided I might as well.

By chance, I managed to get it.

Along with that, I also obtained the textbooks by Altland and Simons,  
Nakahara's textbook on topology, and Xiao-Gang Wen's textbook.  
Lucky.

At the used bookstore, I also found Audrey Tang's \textit{Plurality}  
and Milton Friedman's \textit{Capitalism and Freedom}.

I created this Misc. notebook.
