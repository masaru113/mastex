\section{Wednesday, October 1, 2025}

I gave my wife this month's allowance, but our household budget is tight.



\section{Thursday, October 2, 2025}

I was planning to go to eat Kenyan food with a friend for lunch, but the Kenyan restaurant was closed.

Resignedly, we went to our usual Peruvian restaurant in Gotanda. It was delicious as always, so it turned out to be a very good outcome.

After the meal, we chatted over coffee at a cafe.

The topic of how being in an athletic club in college is useful for adapting to society came up.

I also heard a story that one of my students who is bad at math, whom I teach at a cram school, can't even copy mathematical formulas correctly, let alone understand what's written in the textbook.

My friend passed the medical school preparatory school entrance exam, and not only that, but he's already teaching three students.

After the cafe, we parted ways, and then I went to the company office in Shinjuku.

It was good to be able to talk with my friend and with my team members.

I stopped by a used bookstore in Shinjuku on the way home, and it was past 8 PM when I got home.



\section{Friday, October 3, 2025}

I worked on development for my side job all day long.

The read sheet analysis batch is mostly complete.

I talked with the two leaders about CA operational analysis, and with another person who is developing a separate analysis system for CA performance.

It seems that the number of job acceptances is off by one digit.

I suspect it's likely due to the order of operations, whether to do the 30-day or 90-day cut-off first, or whether to set the flag for the most advanced process first.

In the evening, I went out for dinner with a friend in Kita-Senju.

Although there are many restaurants in Kita-Senju that might serve biryani, many of them have irregular closing days, so it's hard to get it.

Today, I ate at Butayama, a ramen shop similar to Ramen Jiro.

I was able to give my friend books by Hannah Arendt and one on causal inference.

On the way home, we had a long talk at our usual standing bar for beer.

I mentioned that I wanted to re-enter a doctoral program and that I had already decided on a specific lab.

My friend seems to have become interested in corporate finance theory.

After I got back, I uploaded my notes on the Keldysh Green Function.



\section{Saturday, October 4, 2025}

A day I spent mostly sleeping.

Richard Rorty's "Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity" arrived. I want to read it.



\section{Sunday, October 5, 2025}

I was a bit sleep-deprived in the morning.

I made some minor corrections to my notes on Fermi liquids.

I'm studying limits in category theory.

It was my birthday today, so we were planning to go out for sushi, but my daughter was running wild in the house, and my wife got tired, so we bought some deli food from a bento shop and ate that instead.

I happened to find a used copy of "Gauge/Gravity Duality: Foundations and Applications" by Ammon and Erdmenger, but it's not very cheap. I'd been thinking about buying it for a while, and I was considering getting it for my birthday.

I was able to acquire it by a stroke of luck.

On top of that, I also got the textbook by Altrand and Simons, the topology textbook by Nakahara, and the textbook by Xiao Gang Wen. Lucky me.

At the used bookstore, I also got "Plurality" by Audrey Tang and "Capitalism and Freedom" by Milton Friedman.
