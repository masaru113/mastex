\section{Algorithmic Trading}

\subsection{What is Algorithmic Trading?}

\begin{frame}{What is Algorithmic Trading?}
	Trading executed automatically by computers
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ■ Also known as automated trading or system trading
	\end{itemize}

	Not all such trading is mathematically sophisticated
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ■ Mathematically sophisticated trading, using standard item marker
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item ・ Statistical methods
			      \item ・ Time series analysis
			      \item ・ Machine learning
			      \item ・ Deep learning
		      \end{itemize}
		\item ■ Trading that isn't mathematically sophisticated
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item ・ Trading that merely automates routine procedures
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item - Simple agency trades
				            \item - Trades targeting momentary arbitrage opportunities
			            \end{itemize}
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives of Algorithmic Trading}
\begin{frame}{Objectives of Algorithmic Trading}
	\scriptsize
	Expanding the stability of profits
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ■ Pursuit of returns
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item ・ Automatically buying low and selling high
			      \item ・ Pursuit of profit opportunities
		      \end{itemize}
		\item ■ Cost reduction
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item ・ Automation of routine execution tasks

			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item - Market impact refers to the increase in one's own trading costs when one's own execution causes prices to move unfavorably. definition
			            \end{itemize}
		      \end{itemize}
		\item ■ Risk control
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item ・ Controlling the execution probability for desired quantities
			      \item ・ Controlling the market risk of one's own positions
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{5ex}
	The pursuit of returns, cost reduction, and risk control involve trade-offs with each other.

\subsection{HFT}
\begin{frame}{HFT \textnormal{(High-Frequency Trading)}}
	\scriptsize
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ■ HFT holds an advantage in market-making and arbitrage algorithms.
		\item ■ To conduct high-frequency and high-speed trading requires:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item 1. Speeding up information acquisition for trading decisions
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item - Narrowing down the information utilized.
				            \item - Accelerating one's own systems.
			            \end{itemize}
			      \item 2. Speeding up the process from information processing to execution
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item - Accelerating the algorithms.
			            \end{itemize}
			      \item 3. Speeding up the arrival of order information at the trading system
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item - Installation of dedicated lines.
				            \item - Shortening transit time through the use of DMA (Direct Market Access).
				            \item - Placing orders from within the same network as the exchange via exchange colocation.
			            \end{itemize}
			      \item 4. Speeding up the processing speed per unit time of exchange and other trading systems
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item - Speed is increasing due to the competition for market share among exchanges.
				            \item - In Japan as well, HFT became possible in 2010 when Arrowhead started operating on the TSE.
			            \end{itemize}
			      \item ・ Since bottlenecks must be avoided, acceleration is necessary in all four areas mentioned above.
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Pros and Cons of HFT}
\begin{frame}{Pros and Cons of HFT}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ■ High-frequency and high-speed trading is thought to utilize market-making algorithms.
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item ・ Therefore, there is an argument that it benefits general investors by supplying liquidity to the market.
			      \item ・ On the other hand, only HFT firms capture profit opportunities, impairing fairness among investors.
			      \item ・ There is also an argument that it harms market stability by repeatedly placing, modifying, and canceling orders at speeds invisible to general investors.
