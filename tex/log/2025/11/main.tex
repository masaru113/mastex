	\textbf{Fact}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Spent the morning writing a resume and completed a high-quality draft in collaboration with Gemini.  
		\item Visited a bookstore in the afternoon to look for life-hack books on generative AI, but none seemed to capture what I was looking for.  
		\item In the evening, had South Indian food in Shibuya with a friend. The city was packed with people, likely because of Halloween.  
		\item Chose a new name for my sole proprietorship: 'Quant Marketing Lab.'  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Event}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Felt deeply impressed by the process of co-creating with generative AI and experienced its potential firsthand.  
		\item Walking through the dense crowd of Shibuya was physically exhausting, yet reaching the restaurant and enjoying the meal brought relief and satisfaction.  
		\item On the way home, exchanged thoughts with my friend about the books we are reading, which rekindled my motivation to read.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Reflection}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The urge to master AI has been intensifying each day, accompanied by a faint sense of urgency.  
		\item The noise and congestion of the city drain my energy, reaffirming that I function best in calm and solitary environments.  
		\item Given the speed of AI's evolution, there is a quiet anxiety about how long today's learning will remain relevant.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Insight}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Generative AI is not merely a tool but a creative partner that enhances the quality of thought itself.  
		\item Learning is less a matter of training for output than a continuous renewal for adaptation.  
		\item The birth of the name 'Quant Marketing Lab' has provided a coherent sense of direction to my intellectual endeavors.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Next Step}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Continue hands-on collaboration with generative AI for at least half a year, cultivating both technical fluency and creative agility.  
		\item Dedicate tomorrow to reading—progressing through 'Childhood's End' and the AI-related books at hand.  
		\item Secure quiet spaces and uninterrupted time to regain the depth of contemplation that nourishes my thinking.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Fact}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Spent the entire day working at home with deep concentration.  
		\item Developed a script to automate the generation of MBA lecture notes.  
		\item Built a system that transcribes audio using OpenAI Whisper and automatically generates LaTeX-formatted notes from a prompt template.  
		\item Worked continuously for about twelve hours from noon until night without a single break.  
		\item Enjoyed the usual family breakfast at McDonald's in the morning, and noticed my two-year-old daughter showing curiosity about the computer.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Event}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Felt a strong sense of delight when the script worked far better than expected, automating tasks and producing high-quality output.  
		\item Found satisfaction in pursuing efficiency driven purely by personal initiative rather than external pressure.  
		\item The sight of my daughter reaching for the computer was endearing, adding warmth to an otherwise intense day.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Reflection}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reaffirmed a tendency to immerse completely in work once focused, often pushing myself to the limits of endurance.  
		\item Realized that mastering AI is not about mechanical operation but about providing it with high-quality data and precise instructions.  
		\item While automation enhances efficiency, it also raises questions about how best to apply one's creative thinking.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Insight}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Experienced firsthand that AI and humans, though playing different roles, exist in a complementary relationship.  
		\item Understood that 'coexistence with AI' is essentially a challenge of how clearly humans can design intent and structure.  
		\item Saw in the natural coexistence of technology and family life a hint toward the future of human work.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Next Step}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Continue reading specialized books on generative AI utilization to broaden the scope of collaboration with AI.  
		\item Consciously take breaks even during long hours of work, maintaining a rhythm between focus and recovery.  
		\item Evolve the current system into a reusable and general workflow that can support both study and professional projects.  
	\end{itemize}
