	\textbf{Fact}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Spent the morning writing a resume and completed a high-quality draft in collaboration with Gemini.
		\item Visited a bookstore in the afternoon to look for life-hack books on generative AI, but none seemed to capture what I was looking for.
		\item In the evening, had South Indian food in Shibuya with a friend. The city was packed with people, likely because of Halloween.
		\item Chose a new name for my sole proprietorship: 'Quant Marketing Lab.'
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Event}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Felt deeply impressed by the process of co-creating with generative AI and experienced its potential firsthand.
		\item Walking through the dense crowd of Shibuya was physically exhausting, yet reaching the restaurant and enjoying the meal brought relief and satisfaction.
		\item On the way home, exchanged thoughts with my friend about the books we are reading, which rekindled my motivation to read.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Reflection}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The urge to master AI has been intensifying each day, accompanied by a faint sense of urgency.
		\item The noise and congestion of the city drain my energy, reaffirming that I function best in calm and solitary environments.
		\item Given the speed of AI's evolution, there is a quiet anxiety about how long today's learning will remain relevant.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Insight}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Generative AI is not merely a tool but a creative partner that enhances the quality of thought itself.
		\item Learning is less a matter of training for output than a continuous renewal for adaptation.
		\item The birth of the name 'Quant Marketing Lab' has provided a coherent sense of direction to my intellectual endeavors.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Next Step}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Continue hands-on collaboration with generative AI for at least half a year, cultivating both technical fluency and creative agility.
		\item Dedicate tomorrow to reading—progressing through 'Childhood's End' and the AI-related books at hand.
		\item Secure quiet spaces and uninterrupted time to regain the depth of contemplation that nourishes my thinking.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Fact}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Spent the entire day working at home with deep concentration.
		\item Developed a script to automate the generation of MBA lecture notes.
		\item Built a system that transcribes audio using OpenAI Whisper and automatically generates LaTeX-formatted notes from a prompt template.
		\item Worked continuously for about twelve hours from noon until night without a single break.
		\item Enjoyed the usual family breakfast at McDonald's in the morning, and noticed my two-year-old daughter showing curiosity about the computer.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Event}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Felt a strong sense of delight when the script worked far better than expected, automating tasks and producing high-quality output.
		\item Found satisfaction in pursuing efficiency driven purely by personal initiative rather than external pressure.
		\item The sight of my daughter reaching for the computer was endearing, adding warmth to an otherwise intense day.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Reflection}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reaffirmed a tendency to immerse completely in work once focused, often pushing myself to the limits of endurance.
		\item Realized that mastering AI is not about mechanical operation but about providing it with high-quality data and precise instructions.
		\item While automation enhances efficiency, it also raises questions about how best to apply one's creative thinking.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Insight}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Experienced firsthand that AI and humans, though playing different roles, exist in a complementary relationship.
		\item Understood that 'coexistence with AI' is essentially a challenge of how clearly humans can design intent and structure.
		\item Saw in the natural coexistence of technology and family life a hint toward the future of human work.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Next Step}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Continue reading specialized books on generative AI utilization to broaden the scope of collaboration with AI.
		\item Consciously take breaks even during long hours of work, maintaining a rhythm between focus and recovery.
		\item Evolve the current system into a reusable and general workflow that can support both study and professional projects.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Facts}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The day was quietly busy, spent creating MBA lecture notes with the assistance of generative AI.
		\item My methods for data handling and prompt crafting grew more refined, giving me a sense that my learning process is becoming more efficient.
		\item This led to the idea of sharing these lecture notes at work to help elevate the entire team's learning.
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Events \& Impressions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There was a distinct sense of accomplishment at moments when I successfully crafted an effective prompt.
		\item A feeling of fulfillment arose as the learning process started to become gradually systematized within my mind.
		\item It became clear that having an audience (even an implied one) provides motivation for persistence and helps ensure quality is maintained.
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Reflection \& Analysis}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Having the AI generate outputs in a quiz format proved effective; it became apparent that this transforms passive lecture content into active engagement with the material.
		\item Designing 'learning' as a structured system clearly deepens my own concentration and understanding—a personal-trait this process reaffirmed.
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Insights}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Crafting precise instructions for the generative AI is, in itself, direct training for organizing one's own thoughts.
		\item Externalizing the learning structure through the AI provided a tangible experience of how thinking skills can be honed more efficiently.
	\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Next Steps}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The goal now is to learn more advanced applications of generative AI, enabling its use at a much deeper level.
		\item Time will be invested not only in the MBA studies but also in learning about generative AI itself, with the aim of enhancing overall intellectual productivity.
	\end{itemize}
