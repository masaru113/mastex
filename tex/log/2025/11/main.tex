	\textbf{Fact}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Spent the morning writing a resume and completed a high-quality draft in collaboration with Gemini.  
		\item Visited a bookstore in the afternoon to look for life-hack books on generative AI, but none seemed to capture what I was looking for.  
		\item In the evening, had South Indian food in Shibuya with a friend. The city was packed with people, likely because of Halloween.  
		\item Chose a new name for my sole proprietorship: 'Quant Marketing Lab.'  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Event}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Felt deeply impressed by the process of co-creating with generative AI and experienced its potential firsthand.  
		\item Walking through the dense crowd of Shibuya was physically exhausting, yet reaching the restaurant and enjoying the meal brought relief and satisfaction.  
		\item On the way home, exchanged thoughts with my friend about the books we are reading, which rekindled my motivation to read.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Reflection}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The urge to master AI has been intensifying each day, accompanied by a faint sense of urgency.  
		\item The noise and congestion of the city drain my energy, reaffirming that I function best in calm and solitary environments.  
		\item Given the speed of AI’s evolution, there is a quiet anxiety about how long today’s learning will remain relevant.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Insight}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Generative AI is not merely a tool but a creative partner that enhances the quality of thought itself.  
		\item Learning is less a matter of training for output than a continuous renewal for adaptation.  
		\item The birth of the name 'Quant Marketing Lab' has provided a coherent sense of direction to my intellectual endeavors.  
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Next Step}  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Continue hands-on collaboration with generative AI for at least half a year, cultivating both technical fluency and creative agility.  
		\item Dedicate tomorrow to reading—progressing through 'Childhood's End' and the AI-related books at hand.  
		\item Secure quiet spaces and uninterrupted time to regain the depth of contemplation that nourishes my thinking.  
	\end{itemize}
